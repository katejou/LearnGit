# Pluralsight Course: Git Fundamentals

Download, Modified and Practiced by Shin Jou (Kate)


I listed the cmd that I have learn and used on cmdEx.md


I keep the Course Resources in Course Resources.md


And other than that I haven't change a thing on this repo, so I don't own any of the copy right.


I push it to my github just to document my notes and show that I have put some effort on learning git.
